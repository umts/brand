Branding for rails apps.

## Usage

Documentation is hosted on [github pages](https://github.io/umts/brand).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on [GitHub][github].

Due to automatic version detection in our release process, **all commits to the master branch must follow
[conventional commits][conventional-commits] formatting.** Pay close attention to this when squashing your PRs and
setting your commit messages on the main branch.

## Development

- gem distribution files are located in `lib/`
- npm distribution files are located in `dist/`

## Release

Releases are (mostly) automated using [semantic-release][semantic-release]. It can be run using the `deploy.yml` github
action, which has a manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger.

Again, **all commits to the master branch must follow [conventional commits][conventional-commits] format.** Verify
that all commits since the last release adhere to the standard before triggering a release.
